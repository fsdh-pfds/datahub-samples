## Instructions

1. Open your terminal.

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/projects
    ```

    ```

4. Navigate into the cloned repository:
    ```bash
    cd datahub-demos
    ```

5. Install the required Python packages. According to the README, you need Dash and Pandas. You can install them with pip:
    ```bash
    pip install dash pandas
    ```

6. Run the application. According to the README, the main file is `minimal.py`:
    ```bash
    python minimal.py
    ```
